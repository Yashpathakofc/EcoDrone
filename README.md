The drone will capture the data collected through sensors from the ground levels in the form of csv file with parameters as temperature,humidity,NPK and wind speed,
and the raspberry pi fitted on the drone will convert that csv into json and send to server to create an API to fetch the data on the mobile application as well as the website.
